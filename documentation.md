## 1. Project Plan for Testing, Implementation, and Validation

### 1.1 Team Roles and Responsibilities
Our team consists of **Ahmed, Herdi, Maxim, Annika, and Kim**, with roles distributed as follows:

| **Team Member**  | **Role**  | **Responsibilities**  |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Ahmed**  | Issue Resolution & Implementation  | Implementing fixes for new date formats in `Period` class and modifying `parse_time_string` to integrate logic for these formats. |
| **Herdi**  | Repository Preparation, Test Execution & Additional Fixes  | Setting up the environment, running the full test suite, integrating fixes, and handling additional bug fixes related to `Period` class behavior. |
| **Maxim, Annika, Kim**  | Testing Team  | Writing, documenting, and structuring test cases in `test_period.py`. Running and validating test cases before and after implementation. Ensuring coverage analysis is performed. |

### 1.2 Current Project Plan
This project plan outlines how we implemented, tested, and validated the new date formats and additional fixes before merging into pandas.

#### 1.2.1 Issue Overview
We have implemented four new date formats in the `Period` class:

1. **ISO 8601 Ordinal Dates** (e.g., `"1981-095"` → Interpreted as April 5, 1981).
2. **Multi-Year Spans** (e.g., `"2019-2021"` → Represents the range of years 2019 to 2021).
3. **Week Start-End Ranges** (e.g., `"20170123-20170129"` → Interpreted as a full week).
4. **Quarter-Based Multi-Year Periods** (e.g., `"2023Q1-2024Q3"` → Generates a quarterly range).
5. **`DateParseError` on weeks from the 24th century onwards**
6. **`DateParseError` on weeks in the 60s, 70s, 80s, or 90s** of any century.
7. **Correcting `freq` misinterpretations**, ensuring that hours are no longer mistaken for minutes in certain string formats.

#### 1.2.2 Implementation, Testing, and Validation
The **implementation, testing, and validation** of the new formats and fixes were conducted **in parallel** by the team. All team members contributed to different aspects of development, and the documentation was **iteratively revised and refined** after testing.

##### **Test Preparation (Before Implementation)**
- The **testing team (Maxim, Annika, and Kim)** worked on:
  - Writing **test cases** covering the issue requirements/features.
  - Documenting test cases, describing **what is tested and how they connect** to the feature.
  - Adding test descriptions as **issue documentation** and **method docstrings** in `test_period.py`.
  - Executing **test cases to confirm failure before implementation**, validating that the issue exists.

##### **Feature Implementation**
- **Ahmed** worked on:
  - Modifying `Period` and `parse_time_string` to **support the new formats**.
  - Pushing the fixes to a **feature branch** for testing.
- **Herdi** worked on:
  - **Integrating the fixes** into the repository.
  - Ensuring **smooth compatibility** with existing pandas functionality.
  - **Implementing fixes for additional issues**, including `DateParseErrors` and frequency misinterpretations.

##### **Test Execution (After Implementation)**
- The **testing team**:
  - Executed the **full pandas test suite** to verify that new changes do not break existing functionality.
  - Ran the **new test cases** to ensure they **passed after implementation**.

##### **Coverage and Final Validation**
- The **testing team** analyzed:
  - **Test coverage**, ensuring that **key execution paths** were tested.
  - Re-ran the **full test suite** to verify coverage levels.

### 1.2.3. Documentation & Refinement
Throughout the project, **all team members contributed** to the documentation, ensuring that it accurately described the issue, testing strategy, and implementation details. After completing the implementation and testing, the documentation was **revised and refined** to reflect the final methodology and test results.

#### **Key Documentation Deliverables:**
- **Issue documentation** describing **requirements, test cases, and feature mapping**.  
- **Test case descriptions** added to **test_period.py**.  
- Final **test results and coverage analysis documentation**.  
- **Structured patch submitted** to pandas for review.

### 1.3 **Future Project Plan: Enhancing `Period` Class**

#### **Planned Features for Next Iteration**
- **Business Years Not Starting in January**
  - Support fiscal years with **custom start months** (e.g., `"2023FY-Apr"`).
  - Modify `Period` parsing to recognize and handle non-January year starts.

- **Quarters Starting in Custom Months**
  - Extend quarter parsing to support **non-standard starts** (e.g., `"2024Q1-Feb"`).
  - Ensure consistency with fiscal calendars and existing pandas behavior.

- **Business Days Support**
  - Introduce **business day-based periods** (e.g., `"2023-05-BD"`).
  - Align with pandas’ existing **BusinessDay (`BD`) frequency**.
