# Assignment and plans
### Function Assignments:
- Each group member will analyze, test, and improve a specific function in `groupby.py` from Pandas:
  - **Herdi**: `apply()`
  - **Ahmed**: `quantile()`
  - **Maxim**: `shift()` 
  - **Kim**: `_evaluate_numexp()`
  - **Annika**: `time()`

### Tools
  - Measuring complexity using `Lizard`.
  - Manually instrumenting coverage with print/logging statements.
  - Comparing results with an automated coverage tool such as `Coverage.py`.
    - Install `Coverage.py` by runnning `python3 -m pip install coverage`. Documentation can be found [here](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.12/).
### Tasks for Each Member:
  - Identify decision points and track execution paths.
  - Compare manual vs. automated coverage results.
  - Write new test cases to improve coverage.
  - Document findings, including:
    - Complexity scores.
    - Test reports.
    - Coverage improvements.

### Final Deliverables:
  - Report of findings and refactoring suggestions. (For each function: Make sure you have the complexity scores, manual instrumentation runnable output, the automated coverage tool's output, your suggestions for the refactoring).
  - URL to the updated repository.
  - Coverage information (e.g., number of code lines, coverage percentage) can be referenced from Pandas' online coverage tool.

### Deadlines:
  - All implementations must be completed by **Tuesday (hard deadline)**.
  - Report writing will be done on **Wednesday**.
